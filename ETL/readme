ETL with Python and SQL:
python playes the orchestrator role, python driver manage the whole process 
while python helpers do the support functions such as CSV to DB transformation, 
Running stored procedures, etc.
SQL part consist of DDL for able definitions and stored procedures with temporary 
tables technique which improve the performance of stored procedures.
Quality control checks take place in the transformation phase when the clean data 
and non clean data get separated and procedure moves the non clean data into QC tables
where user can complete the data and in the custom columns set the action to G(Go),
so n the next run the procedure will also import the corrected rows from QC tables.
Data validation steps could be nsterted into data validation definition table and 
the procedure will write the validation result and conclusion into validation result 
table.
Finally after validation process writes the reports into CSV files.
